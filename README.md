# _BayesReef_: A Bayesian inference framework for _pyReef-Core_ using MCMC methods

## Overview
![Flowchart of BayesReef process. A fusion of multiple sources of data is used to create prior probability distributions on free parameters. Following this, BayesReef is initiated with a vector of free parameters are drawn from the prior. The MCMC sampler uses a Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm as a basis to accept or reject proposed samples. The sampler terminates when all the allocated samples have been assessed.](figures/BayesReef-MCMC-flowchart.png)


_BayesReef_ is a framework for implementing Bayesian inference on the deterministic model, _pyReef-Core_. It simulates data from the _pyReef-Core_ stratigraphic forward model (SFM) to generate samples which are used to approximate the posterior distribution parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. _BayesReef_ is used to quantify uncertainty in  _pyReef-Core_  predictions and estimate parameters in the form of a probability distribution. 

_BayesReef_ is capable of inference of reef core data from the perspective of the depth structure and the time structure of a core. Studies have shown that the software produces accurate parameter estimation and mean model prediction for two- and four-dimensional problems with _pyReef-Core_ (Pall et al., unpublished).

### MCMC methods
MCMC methods, when applied to numerical system models, are used to approximate the posterior distribution of a parameter of interest by randomly sampling in a probabilistic space via a random walk. The random walk generates a chain of samples that are dependent on the current step, but are independent of the previous steps in the chain. The MCMC random walk is designed to take adequately large samples in regions near the solutions of best fit in order to approximate the distribution of parameter values in a model. _BayesReef_ uses the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm MCMC method, which allows for asymmetrical proposals.

MCMC methods are a trademark of a Bayesian inference approach, which is based on Bayes Rule:

This formula encapsulates our _prior_ beliefs about a parameter and the _likelihood_ that a chosen parameter value explains the observed data. Combining the prior and likelihood distributions determine the _posterior distribution_, which tells us the parameter values that maximise the probability of the observed data. 

To visualise the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC technique, an animation of an example is provided below (Huber, 2016).

### Depth-based and time-based inference

_BayesReef_ estimates the posterior distribution of parameters by comparing different forms of data extracted from _pyReef-Core_ simulations. We have two methods of doing this. 

Data about the **depth structure** or the **time structure** of a core can be used as a basis of comparison. The **depth structure** refers to which coralgal assemblage occurs at a given depth interval. The **time structure** of a core refers to which assemblage (or sediment) is deposited at each time interval over the course of the simulation time. Both perspectives on a reef drill core are presented in the figure below.

## Installation

The code is available from our github [page](https://github.com/pyReef-model/BayesReef.git) and can be obtained either from this page or using **git clone**
```
git clone https://github.com/pyReef-model/BayesReef.git
```
Download the prerequisite python packages provided in the ***installation.txt*** file.

Once donwloaded, navigate to the ***BayesReef*** folder and run the following command:
```
pip install -e /workspace/volume/pyReefCore/
```

## Usage

_BayesReef_ is initiated from python scripts directly with Python 2.7.


***multinom_mcmc_t.py*** and ***multinom_mcmc_d.py*** are the main MCMC scripts from which to run BayesReef. There are 27 free parameters in these file, which includes:

* Population dynamics parameters
  * Malthusian parameter &epsilon; 
  * The Assemblage Interaction Matrix (AIM) parameters &alpha;<sub>m</sub> and  &alpha;<sub>s</sub>
* Hydrodynamic flow exposure threshold parameters (for each assemblage) 
  * _f_<sub>flow</sub><sup>1</sup>
  * _f_<sub>flow</sub><sup>2</sup>
  * _f_<sub>flow</sub><sup>3</sup>
  * _f_<sub>flow</sub><sup>4</sup>
* Sediment imput exposure threshold parameters (for each assemblage)
  * _f_<sub>sed</sub><sup>1</sup>
  * _f_<sub>sed</sub><sup>2</sup>
  * _f_<sub>sed</sub><sup>3</sup>
  * _f_<sub>sed</sub><sup>4</sup>


With alteration, the code is capable of parameterising many other _pyReef-Core_ variables. 


***multinom_mcmc_t_constrained.py*** and ***multinom_mcmc_d_constrained.py*** are similar to the main MCMC scripts, but offer lesser free parameters (up to 4) to allow for low-dimensional experiments with _BayesReef_.


***input_synth.xml*** defines the fixed parameters in _pyReef-Core_. For a greater discussion on _pyReef-Core_, visit the Github repository [here](https://github.com/pyReef-model/pyReefCore).

***1DLikSrf_glv.py***  creates a figure of marginal likelihood (1-D) of population dynamics parameters.

***1DLikSrf_thres.py***  creates a figure of marginal likelihood (1-D) of environmental threshold parameters.

***3DLikSrf_glv.py***  creates a figure of bivariate likelihood (3-D) of population dynamics parameters.

***1DLikSrf_thres.py***  creates a figure of bivariate likelihood (3-D) of environmental threshold parameters.

***runModel.py*** simulates a iteration of _pyReef-Core_ without the Bayesian inference framework.
